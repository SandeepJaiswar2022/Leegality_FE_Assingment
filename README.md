## Architectural Decisions

### 1. URL as Single Source of Truth

All filter state lives in `URLSearchParams` via React Router's `useSearchParams`. This means:

- Filters survive page refreshes
- "Back" button restores exact filter/page state
- Links are shareable and bookmarkable
- No need for localStorage, context, or Redux

### 2. Two-Phase Fetching Strategy

- **With category**: Fetch ALL products for that category (DummyJSON supports `limit=0`), then apply brand/price/pagination client-side. This gives accurate filter counts and correct pagination totals.
- **Without category**: Use server-side pagination (`skip/limit`). Brand/price filters apply client-side on current page. This keeps initial load fast.

### 3. React Query for Data Layer

- Queries are cached with `staleTime` — navigating back to the listing page doesn't re-fetch unnecessarily.
- `placeholderData: (prev) => prev` gives instant UI on page change (previous data stays visible while next page loads).
- `isFetching` vs `isLoading` used separately — skeleton appears only on first load; an overlay spinner appears on subsequent navigations.

### 4. Service / Hook Separation

- `productService.js` — pure async functions, no React dependencies. Easily testable in isolation.
- `hooks/` — wrap service calls with React Query, handle derived state (filtering, brand extraction, pagination math).

### 5. Dark Theme via CSS Custom Properties

All colors are defined as CSS variables in `:root`. This makes the theme easily customizable and avoids Tailwind dark-mode class overhead. Font pairing: **Syne** (geometric, bold — headings) + **DM Sans** (humanist, readable — body).

## Filter Logic

All three filters combine with AND logic:

```
final products = products
  .filter(category)     ← server-side
  .filter(brand)        ← client-side (multi-select OR within brand)
  .filter(price)        ← client-side (minPrice ≤ price ≤ maxPrice)
```

When any filter changes, `page` resets to `1` automatically.

---

## Assumptions

- DummyJSON `limit=0` returns all products for a category (verified, works).
- Brand data is extracted from products; some products may have `undefined` brand (filtered out).
- The app is read-only — no cart, auth, or persistence beyond filter state.
- Images are served from DummyJSON CDN; no fallback image handling needed for this demo.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] **Search** — full-text search bar using `/products/search?q=`
- [ ] **Sort** — by price, rating, discount (client-side)
- [ ] **Cart** — add to cart with persisted state (Zustand + localStorage)
- [ ] **Auth** — login/register using DummyJSON `/auth` endpoints
- [ ] **Image gallery** — click thumbnail to swap main image on detail page
- [ ] **Comparison** — side-by-side product comparison
- [ ] **PWA** — offline support with service worker
- [ ] **Testing** — Vitest + React Testing Library for hooks and components
- [ ] **Virtualization** — react-virtual for very long product lists
